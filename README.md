# CVIP-Android-App-Development
This is a project created for my internship at Codercave. 
To-Do_App: It's a web application that helps users manage their tasks and to-do lists efficiently. With this app, you can create, update, and prioritize tasks, set due dates, and mark tasks as completed. It also provides a user-friendly interface and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
